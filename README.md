# Renovator
is supposed to be a simple utility that's supposed to generate color themes from an image.

<script src="https://coolors.co/palette-widget/widget.js"></script>
<script data-id="013505028264684915">new CoolorsPaletteWidget("013505028264684915", ["171a21","617073","7a93ac","92bcea","afb3f7"]); </script>

The functionality is nowhere close, and as this is my first go project, don't expect this to come to life ever.

<script src="https://coolors.co/palette-widget/widget.js"></script>
<script data-id="07711400277854734">new CoolorsPaletteWidget("07711400277854734", ["f6f0ed","bbb193","c2948a","7ea8be","28536b"]); </script>

The main idea, is that projects like [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) or various back-ends for it, do not actually provide a color scheme, but a selection of 16 colors sourced from the provided image. What annoys me about the project also, is the fact is that it forcefully replaces current configs, when it is up to the user to decide what to use the generated colors for.

<script src="https://coolors.co/palette-widget/widget.js"></script>
<script data-id="04968928666429355">new CoolorsPaletteWidget("04968928666429355", ["daff7d","b2ef9b","8c86aa","81559b","7e3f8f"]); </script>

In the final stage, this program should in theory, grab 16 colors that resemble the base16 colors the closest, put them in a correct order, and offer the user a chance to decide if a given theme is worth saving as an `.Xresources` file.

The project is abandoned by design, as i do not plan on working on this, but it's a project regardless. Code donations welcome.
